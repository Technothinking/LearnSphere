**LearnSphere** is a Deep Reinforcement Learning based Adaptive Learning System which dynamically adapts according to the strength and weaknesses of the student. It uses an algorithm called PPO which is proximal policy optimisation, this algorithm focuses on optimising the average reward over all the episodes. This project is yet in progress but to give a brief overview, it is good for personalized learning as the model alters the learning material to different difficulties and specific sub modules in which the student is unable to perform consistently. 8 enables the student to not just mug up but have long term retention.
